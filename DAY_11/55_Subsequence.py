'''Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false'''

'''Logic

Initialize a variable prev_index to -1.
This keeps track of the index of the last matched character from s in t.

Loop through each character ch in s:

For each ch, scan t from prev_index + 1 onward.

As soon as you find a match t[i] == ch, update prev_index = i.

This ensures every next character in s appears after the previous one in t.

If the character is not found in the rest of t:

Set a found flag to False.

If found remains False after the inner loop, return False immediately â€” this means s is not a subsequence of t.

If the loop completes successfully, it means all characters of s were found in order in t, so return True.'''
